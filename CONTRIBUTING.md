## Changelog

## Debugging

If you encounter any problems. You can try running `task run` to see errors in your terminal.

## Release

Only people in the `CODEOWNERS` file should trigger a new release with these steps:

1. Trigger the [Create release PR Action](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-mcp/actions/workflows/create-release-pr.yml).
2. Get this PR approved & merged in.
3. This will trigger the `Release dbt-mcp` Action. On the `Summary` page of this Action a member of the `CODEOWNERS` file will have to manually approve the release. The rest of the release process is automated.
