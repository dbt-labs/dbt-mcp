List all metrics from the dbt Semantic Layer.

If the user is asking a data-related or business-related question,
this tool should be used as a first step to get a list of metrics
that can be used with other tools to answer the question.

Examples:
- "What are the top 5 products by revenue?"
- "How many users did we have last month?"

Synonyms:
- Pay special attention to any synonyms which are defined in the meta properties returned from metrics
- Use these synonyms to map questions from the user to the appropriate metrics
